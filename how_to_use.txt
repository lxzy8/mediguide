MediGuide E-Doctor - Quick Start Guide
This repository contains the fine-tuned tiiuae/falcon-rw-1b model and a Python script (inference_tester.py) for an interactive medical guidance chatbot.

The model provides preliminary, text-based advice in a professional tone, always disclaiming that it's not a substitute for professional diagnosis.

ðŸš€ Get Started in 5 Steps:
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Git

GPU (Recommended): For faster inference. CPU fallback is available but will be slow.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Download all project files by running this command in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/lxzy8/mediguide.git

Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into the cloned folder:

cd mediguide

Step 3: Install Required Libraries
Install the Python dependencies:

pip install torch transformers peft bitsandbytes accelerate

Step 4: Run the Inference Script
Launch the interactive chatbot:

python inference_tester.py

Step 5: Interact with the Model
The model will load (may take a few minutes).

Type your medical questions at the Your Question: prompt.

Press Enter to get a response.

Type exit and press Enter to quit.

Important Notes:
GPU Recommended: Script defaults to GPU. Falls back to CPU if no compatible GPU is found (CPU inference is very slow).

Model Size: This is a 1-billion parameter model, requiring significant RAM (especially GPU VRAM).
